      and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. After
      the collapse of the empire and a relative decline, France endured a tumultuous
      succession of governments culminating in the establishment of the French
      Third Republic in 1870 in the midst of the Franco-Prussian War. France
      was one of the prominent participants of World War I."
